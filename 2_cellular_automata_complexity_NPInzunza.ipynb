    "# The Abelian sandpile\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement the celebrated [Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381), also known as the \"Abelian sandpile.\" This cellular automaton describes a lattice in which sand grains are continuously dropped onto random locations at a fixed rate, resulting in the formation of random sandpiles. When the sandpiles grow too high, they topple, resulting in avalanches that distribute grains to all of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote the number of grains at a site $(x, y)$ as $z(x, y)$, a single \"topple\" event of the BTW model has the following update rule, which triggers only when $z \\geq 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z(x, y) \\rightarrow z(x, y) - 4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lr}\n",
    "    z(x + 1, y) \\leftarrow z(x + 1, y) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "    z(x - 1, y) \\leftarrow z(x - 1, y) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "    z(x, y + 1) \\leftarrow z(x, y + 1) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "    z(x, y - 1) \\leftarrow z(x, y - 1) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A topple event thus consists of a single site decreasing in height by four grains, and then distributing these grains to each of its north, south, east, and west neighbors---but not its diagonal neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a single topple event, the entire lattice is checked again to see if any other sites now have $z \\geq 4$, in which case those sites are toppled, too. If a site located at the boundary of the domain topples, then any grains that would go out of bounds are assumed to be permanently lost from the system. After all sites reach a state where $z \\leq 4$, the avalanche has concluded. We then add a sand grain to a random new site, and calculate any new resulting avalanches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idealized system has several interesting properties: the continuous addition of grains represents a slow-timescale driving process, which effectively injects energy into the system. The avalances represent fast-timescale response dynamics, and the grains that fall off the edges represent dissipation---they prevent avalanches from continuing forever undriven. Despite its seeming simplicity, the BTK model represents perhaps the earliest widely-studied toy model of \"self-organized criticality,\" a well-known hypothesis in nonequilibrium statistical physics that driven, dissipative systems tend to tune themselves into maximally-critical states (there are always sandpiles on the verge of toppling). The sandpile has been used as a thought experiment describing an incredible array of diverse systems, including: starts and stops in dragging friction, [earthquakes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB094iB11p15635), timings between geyser eruptions, [timings of pulsar glitches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6528), [fluctuations in an ultracold atomic gas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1908-6), [neuronal activity patterns in the brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00166/full), [flux pinning](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.919), and many other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple signature of self-organized-criticality observed in the sandpile model, which also represents an easy readout for experimental data, is the appearance of $1/f$ noise in the system's power spectrum, where $f$ denotes frequency. This distribution implies that avalanche durations have a skewed distribution, where larger events happen less frequently. For an experimental system, this results in \"crackling\" or brown noise in the detector. In the BTW model, the authors note that a $1/f$ distribution of rare events in the frequency corresponds to a $1/T$ distribution of waiting times between rare events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will implement the BTW model, and then test for the appearance of $1/f$ noise."

This is because I do not check the entire lattice at ones to see what needs to be toppled.  After a topple, I only look at whether the neighbors affected need to be toppled, and if the neighbors' neighbors need to be toppled after that, etc.\n",

    "    The memory usage goes as N for N=n^2, n=no. rows or columns of lattice.  This is because a given lattice will have memory n^2 for each site, so in adding more sites, the growth in memory storage will be proportional to (n2^2)/(n1^2), or N2/N1, so it scales linearly in N.  But there is an extra affect by the extended avalanche mechanism explained above for larger lattice sites.  There will be that much more history to store, so the volume will increase linearly according to whatever this other scaling factor is, say f.  So memory scaling ~ N*f\n",

Much of the time, we add a grain of sand to a site, and the site is not critical.  With random assignment, of grains to a lattice as our initial condition, there is only a 1/4 chance that the site will topple at the very first drop.  As we continue, we are more likely to topple a site by adding a grain, as we have repeatedly added sand to the lattice.  The avalanches also cascade along the lattice, adding sand to neighbors of topple points.  At certain points in the game, the lattice might be filled with many critical sites adjacent to each other, and avalanches being caused by adjacent critical sites, with so many of them lined up, and flowing back in and out of each other, this could lead to a few very long avalanches which break the negative power law distribution.\n",

    "The BTK model is called the \"Abelian\" sandpile because the final stable configuration is invariant to the order of toppling events. For example, instead of toppling the pile to completion after each addition, we could add $M$ several grains at once, and then perform a series of topples selecting unstable sites in any order until a stable configuration is achieved. The final sandpile would be identical to the one we would get if we simulated the pile through $M$ full additions sequentially. The Abelian property also means that we have a variety of choices of algorithms for implementing the toppling process resulting from the addition of a single grain; the sandpile will return the same solution regardless of whether a breadth-first search, depth-first search, or iterative solution is used. Importantly, each of these solution methods is, in principle, simulating a different physical process and chain of events, but the particular Abelian property of this model means that the final solution is identical.\n",

A similar distinction arises in other types of dynamical systems; for example, when numerically integrating partial differential equations, finite difference methods update each lattice point based on their differences from neighboring points, approximating spatial derivatives. However, for many classes of partial differential equations, finite element methods instead update each lattice point based on the weighted average of all its neighbors, approximating spatial integrals.\n",

    "The BTK cellular automaton represents a great example of a simple, toy computational model that exhibits non-trivial properties found in other, much more elaborate problems. It can be considered a [dynamical universality class](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.1690), meaning that many problems map onto it, independently of their microscopic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will consider a well-known example of a universality class describing a nonequilibrium phase transition: the directed percolation problem. This problem is usually attributed to [Broadbent & Hammersley in 1957](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/percolation-processes/C00CC4943F48228F8AC8031092FE84EC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is deceptively simple: given a D-dimensional lattice (for our purposes, a 2D grid), we randomly mark sites as \"blocked\" with probability $p$. The remaining sites are \"open\" for water to flow. For a given value of $p$, what is the probability that water poured into the top of the lattice will percolate to the bottom row through a chain of connected open sites? This problem is *directed percolation* because it has a preferred direction (water flows from top to bottom). We will assume two open sites are connected if one is north, south, east, or west of the other---but *not* diagonal. This corresponds to [von Neumann neighborhood rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood).\n",
    "\n",
    "A percolation simulation should take a binary array, and return True if it percolates, and False if it does not. There are many ways to implement a percolation algorithm, most of which involve simulating the addition of water to the grid. \n",
    "+ *Iterative Solution.* One option would be start with the top row, mark all open sites as \"filled,\" and then pass to the next row and search for open sites connected to filled sites. Some addtional care is required, however, because water can pass through channels within a row until it reaches sites that are not directly below filled sites. One workaround would be to perform multiple iterative passes until the filled lattice stops changing. Another edge case is the case where water needs to pass through an uphill channel in order to make it to the bottom---this can be solved by passing over the lattice first from top to bottom, and then vice versa.\n",
    "+ *Depth-first search (DFS).* Another simulation option would be a depth-first-search, where we start from each site on the top row and we search for any chain of North/Sout/East/West hops that leads to the other side of the lattice, marking all visited sites as filled with water. This last methods demonstrates the conceptual simularity between directed percolation and solving a maze puzzle; the only difference that the \"blocked\" sites in a maze are non-random. \n",

    "Directed percolation maps onto all sorts of interesting problems in physics and graph theory. There are very direct applications of percolation to [flow in porous media](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/14/5/012/meta), as well as [electrical conductance](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.26.5293) and [light propagation in disordered materials](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.234503). A great example of the broader relevance of the directed percolation universality class is [recent work](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3548) showing similar scaling exponents describing both ecological collapse and pipe turbulence, which arise due to both systems belonging to the Directed Percolation universality class. [Another recent paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007508) uses percolation theory to understand electrical signalling between neighboring cells in a biofilm. \n",
